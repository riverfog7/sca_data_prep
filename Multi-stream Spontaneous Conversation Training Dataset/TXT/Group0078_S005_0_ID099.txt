[294.986,300.729]	ID099	female	and it's you know it's it's very like it's not at all they're demanding attention wise and you just let it play in the background.

[306.900,310.250]	ID099	female	type of comedy because like I just think it's really poorly written.
[310.500,315.950]	ID099	female	so I end up just hate watching the whole like a whole series or like until the very final season.
[316.200,317.390]	ID099	female	and um.
[317.910,320.240]	ID099	female	you know some may call it a waste of time and you know.

[398.370,399.440]	ID099	female	but I do admit like.
[400.140,403.430]	ID099	female	on some like rational level it's like word that you have to like.
[403.710,404.540]	ID099	female	prompt.

[411.870,413.180]	ID099	female	oh right um.
[413.640,417.080]	ID099	female	so I think that the reason they don't have laugh tracks though it's because it's um.
[417.660,422.690]	ID099	female	the the format is a monumentary right like the fake like filming a documentary for both of them.
[424.200,427.250]	ID099	female	so so if we were to have a laugh track but um.
[427.770,429.050]	ID099	female	but yeah like ah.
[429.540,436.910]	ID099	female	I mean it's fun at first right the characters are like fun but then like at some point for me it just gets old but like I also understand why like they like.

[515.520,517.670]	ID099	female	it was presented to me was never like.
[518.190,519.650]	ID099	female	you know truly compelling.

[526.740,529.490]	ID099	female	full house though I only I only um.
[529.740,531.170]	ID099	female	I've only heard of it because like.
[531.360,535.910]	ID099	female	you know it's like iconic for like um when did it come out it was it like uh nineties?
[538.020,541.310]	ID099	female	yeah so I just remember like the aesthetic being um.
[541.830,543.860]	ID099	female	the doesn't have the Olsen twins too.

[569.220,570.470]	ID099	female	I watched Wanda vision.
[570.630,572.390]	ID099	female	right did you watch Wanda vision?
[578.040,583.040]	ID099	female	oh okay um Wanda vision is the um so you know after um after.
[583.440,590.990]	ID099	female	after marvel did their whole like a phase uh phase three movies will now they're starting a new phase and it's um it's a lot of Disney plus T V shows.
[591.420,591.920]	ID099	female	right.
[592.200,594.470]	ID099	female	um I mean it's on Disney plus but like.
[594.600,597.560]	ID099	female	you know like if you go on like the right website you'll find it right.
[597.600,598.370]	0	none	[LAUGHTER]
[598.590,599.480]	ID099	female	but um.
[600.150,604.040]	ID099	female	Wanda vision was the first T V show to put it off and honestly I think.
[604.560,605.240]	ID099	female	um.
[605.460,608.390]	ID099	female	like at least the first half was really well written.
[608.580,613.430]	ID099	female	ah basically they took r- they really took advantage of the episodic nature of the show.
[613.680,615.920]	ID099	female	so basically um every episode.
[616.080,618.920]	ID099	female	Wanda and vision or basically it's unified.
[619.350,620.840]	ID099	female	we're talking about sitcoms right?
[620.910,623.570]	ID099	female	so the first few episodes are very sitcom like.
[623.790,626.900]	ID099	female	but it's more like a parody like they're making fun of this account ropes.
[627.270,631.220]	ID099	female	um but each episode takes place in a different era so I think it's set on the fifties.
[631.470,634.580]	ID099	female	and then sixties seventies eighties right and then nineties.
[635.460,635.960]	ID099	female	um.
[636.030,640.160]	ID099	female	so at each like era, they make fun of it like the ster- the.
[640.530,644.270]	ID099	female	the stereotypes and the and the tropes of of the sitcoms of that era.
[644.520,647.420]	ID099	female	but then um there are some moments that are like.
[648.510,652.640]	ID099	female	off putting like it's clear that it's not like in the whole sitcom troop.
[652.920,655.430]	ID099	female	and it's kinda like a self worthwhile breaking.
[655.470,657.140]	ID099	female	because they don't break the forth wall but like.
[657.510,661.220]	ID099	female	it's it's off it's clearly not in the whole like sitcom narrative.
[661.470,663.800]	ID099	female	and that's that's that's just um.
[664.770,665.630]	ID099	female	cause um.
[665.670,670.280]	ID099	female	well they they always played it and yet or no I don't want to spoil it but I find that so genius how.
[670.590,674.450]	ID099	female	you know it was fun and the sitco- would make make fun of the sitcoms.
[674.460,676.790]	ID099	female	but as a sitcom itself it was also well written.
[676.950,678.560]	ID099	female	and then they're also elements of like.
[678.630,679.670]	ID099	female	mystery and like.
[679.710,684.290]	ID099	female	some of them are bit jump scary but like it's mostly like its mystery and the whole show you're wondering like.
[684.390,686.540]	ID099	female	what's gonna happen and you make up your own theories.
[686.700,689.450]	ID099	female	um the the second half of the series.
[689.760,691.220]	ID099	female	I find that the qaeda.
[691.560,694.760]	ID099	female	they they kind of drop the ball but it wasn't a bad ending it's just.
[695.010,698.780]	ID099	female	it's just wasn't living up to the expectations that I had filled up at that point right.
[699.360,700.610]	ID099	female	but um.
[701.640,703.970]	ID099	female	but yeah I think I think it was um.
[704.760,708.350]	ID099	female	I mean also I'm a a bit of a I'm bias because I'm a big marvel fan.
[708.510,712.520]	ID099	female	but I think the first stuff was really well written and eh the whole series in general made them.
[712.590,713.960]	ID099	female	made lot of marvel fans.
[714.060,714.560]	ID099	female	like.
[714.570,716.540]	ID099	female	ah the characters of Wanda and vision.
[716.580,718.430]	ID099	female	despite like not um.
[718.740,720.980]	ID099	female	you know maybe not giving them more thoughts.
[721.020,721.880]	ID099	female	previously.
[722.070,723.320]	ID099	female	that was my case at least.
[731.760,732.710]	ID099	female	um it's.
[733.033,733.680]	ID099	female	it's.
[733.680,739.640]	ID099	female	it's um I think it's like only like it's not long the thing is like the the the series and along I think it's ah.
[740.550,742.340]	ID099	female	eight maybe ten episodes.
[742.440,744.260]	ID099	female	around around that length you know.
[748.080,749.360]	ID099	female	and um.
[749.400,751.110]	ID099	female	if are are you a marvel fan?
[751.770,753.470]	ID099	female	or like have you at least like watch like.
