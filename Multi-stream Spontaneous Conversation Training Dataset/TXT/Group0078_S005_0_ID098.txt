[1042.200,1042.730]	ID098	male	it is.
[1042.770,1049.630]	ID098	male	wha- what a good thing about that, it's that it's an anthology, so you're not missing anything by you know skipping over episodes, it's totally fine.
[1049.670,1050.980]	ID098	male	that's what I like about it.
[1054.290,1055.660]	ID098	male	yeah, yeah that is.
[1055.820,1058.030]	ID098	male	um, so yeah you can start it.
[1065.480,1066.100]	ID098	male	huh?
[1068.660,1069.220]	ID098	male	during.
[1070.368,1071.620]	ID098	male	they do not have an ark?
[1072.740,1075.070]	ID098	male	during the same theme, like like dystopia.
[1075.290,1076.270]	ID098	male	you know things like that.
[1076.490,1079.000]	ID098	male	um but, yeah you can wa- you can start.
[1079.010,1081.190]	ID098	male	at any episode, you won't miss anything.
[1082.520,1083.830]	ID098	male	they're just that good, yeah.
[1084.290,1085.240]	ID098	male	and and I would.
[1085.340,1089.890]	ID098	male	I would personally recommend you to start from season four, cause that's I think the best season.
[1090.290,1091.090]	ID098	male	yes.
[1100.670,1102.310]	ID098	male	the black mirror movies?
[1103.520,1104.380]	ID098	male	what are those?
[1104.600,1105.160]	ID098	male	wait.
[1134.480,1136.450]	ID098	male	oh I get it, cause um.
[1136.790,1139.612]	ID098	male	I guess it goes into the anthology nature of the show like.
[1139.639,1145.011]	ID098	male	every story is a stand alone thing, so you could expand it and make it into a movie easily.
[1145.670,1147.400]	ID098	male	I think that, that was the idea.

[1174.500,1178.420]	ID098	male	inception but in uh, I think inception was even easier to follow.
