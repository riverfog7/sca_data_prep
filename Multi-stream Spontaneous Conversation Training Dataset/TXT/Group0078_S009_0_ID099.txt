[316.230,317.660]	ID099	female	um your average Joe.
[319.320,321.680]	ID099	female	politics right now are so centered around like.
[321.840,323.570]	ID099	female	identity politics right.

[634.560,636.770]	ID099	female	it's also pandering to the audience in a bit because.
[636.960,639.260]	ID099	female	their audience is mostly a liberal too right.
[639.480,641.240]	ID099	female	but um for him he is.

[1134.870,1136.180]	ID099	female	what got me started is because.

[1163.093,1164.530]	ID099	female	oh and the worst part is like.
[1164.720,1166.810]	ID099	female	so a lot of times she gets like actually like.
[1167.030,1170.530]	ID099	female	she meets people who are who actually like know what they're talking about and wants to debate.
[1171.140,1172.090]	ID099	female	and then she gets like.
